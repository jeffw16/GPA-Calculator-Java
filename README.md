# GPA Calculator by MyWikis
GPA Calculator (Java) is a Java script for calculating high school GPAs. We know how important your GPA is, and let's be honest, who has time to slowly and painfully calculate their GPA when they need to study? Don't worry; it takes less than 3 minutes to get this information now! Just run our script on your computer on the command line/terminal. It's designed to be as adaptive yet simple as possible. And it's even condensed in one tiny script for you to run.

Of course, you can always use our ad-free hosted website at https://www.mywikis.com/products/srcbin/gpacalculator.php for absolutely no charge!

## Requirements
* For Java: We recommend Java 7 and up. We believe, however, that this will work well on Java 6. However, we do not support Java 6 and there are no guarantees!
